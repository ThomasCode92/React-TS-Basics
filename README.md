**About this Repository**<br />
This project is part of the _[React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)_ course from [Academind](https://academind.com).<br />
It is used to get started with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and how to use it in [React.js](https://react.dev/) Projects.

This repository contains 2 folders:

- ts-basics => an introduction to the core features of TypeScript
- todo-app => a React app build with TypeScript (bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) via npm)

**View the React application**<br />
Navigate to the _todo-app_ folder<br />
Run the development server with `npm run start`<br />
This should open your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
